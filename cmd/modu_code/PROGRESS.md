# modu_code product progress

This file tracks product-experience work for `modu_code`. Keep each item small
enough to implement, verify, and commit independently.

## Done

- Status line moved above the input separator, with animated running state,
  persisted completed state, and duration formatting that supports `min`.
- Terminal resize handling keeps the user prompt visible and avoids duplicate
  completed-status lines.
- Model configuration moved into `~/.coding_agent/config.json` with support for
  multiple configured models and an active model.
- `/model` supports listing, switching by configured name, and a TUI picker;
  selected model is persisted back to config.
- Switching models and `/clear` clear in-memory and persisted conversation
  context, then refresh the dynamic system prompt.
- Dynamic prompt environment now includes the actual connected provider/model
  without hardcoding a vendor identity.
- OpenAI-compatible provider retries Xiaomi MiMo-style `reasoning_content`
  failures by dropping assistant history entries that cannot satisfy the API.
- modu_code-owned comments, harness hint tags, and context discovery no longer
  use Claude-specific naming.
- `/context` shows the current prompt/context sources without changing session
  state, including model, cwd, messages, prompt size, memory, context files,
  skills, plan mode, and worktree mode.
- `/doctor` shows runtime diagnostics without changing session state, including
  config path, model, baseUrl reachability, provider registration, API key
  status, context file count, and detected problems.
- Model switching feedback now shows the active entry/name and explicitly says
  whether the conversation context was cleared.
- API failure messages in the TUI now collapse repeated identical errors into a
  counter, compact long multiline errors, and show recovery actions.

## Next

1. Add config commands:
   initialize, validate, and print examples for multi-model config.
2. Add a real `/retry` command for the last failed prompt.
